### **Synopsis**

<h5 style="margin-top:2rem;"><b>Airside and Cargo Operations - <i>Like clockwork: The World below the Wing</i></b></h5>

Curious about the buzz that goes on below the wing, as you look out of your aircraft window? Airside operations comprise complex and overlapping processes, which require strong command and control, and close coordination among the different airport stakeholders.  
  
Listen to our panelists share their perspectives on the full spectrum of airside ground handling and aircraft handling operations, which range from baggage operations, to technical handling of aircraft, aircraft line maintenance, cargo operations and air express services.  
Together, it all comes together like clockwork, to ensure smooth and seamless operations for passengers as well as air cargo.

<h5 style="margin-top:2rem;"><b>Sustainability - <i>Decarbonising the Future of Aviation</i></b></h5>

Decarbonisation has been identified as a realistic way forward to address the greatest existential threat of our time, climate change. As we rebuild our air hub, sustainability will be a key priority and decarbonization will be a major initiative. CAAS plans to publish the Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint later this year, with tangible sustainability initiatives and decarbonization pathways to reduce the sector’s carbon footprint.  
  
Join us to better understand airport and airline stakeholders’ individual and collective efforts to achieve a sustainable air hub, e.g. sustainable aviation fuel, sustainable design for T5, cleaner energy airside vehicles.

<h5 style="margin-top:2rem;"><b>Technology - <i>New Frontiers for Aviation Technology</i></b></h5>

As air travel recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, one key focal area for international aviation, including companies, governments and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), is innovation.  
  
Innovation allows the aviation sector to leverage technology, in digitalization, automation, big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics, to transform the travel experience, introduce new products and services, lower cost, overcome manpower, land and airspace constraints and achieve sustainability goals.  
  
Come hear from our panel of industry experts on thir experiences and perspectives in leveraging digital technology and automation to enhance business operations, and the exciting opportunities that the aviation sector has to offer as it becomes increasingly innovation focused.

<h5 style="margin-top:2rem;"><b>Service - <i>The OneChangi Experience at the World’s Best Airport</i></b></h5>

Changi Airport is more than just a gateway to the world, it is a showcase of seamless operations, symbol of service excellence and shining testament to Singapore’s commitment and pursuit of excellence.  

Join us in our candid chat with key service professionals as they share their breadth of service experience, training requirements and challenges faced in their continuous pursuit to uphold the Singapore OneAviation Experience at the World’s Best Airport.
